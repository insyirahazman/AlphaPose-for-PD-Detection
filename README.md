# AlphaPose for Pose Estimation (CPU Version)

This repository updates and adjusts the existing [AlphaPose](https://github.com/MVIG-SJTU/AlphaPose) implementation to ensure it can run smoothly on **CPU-only machines**. This adaptation is useful for researchers or students who do not have access to an NVIDIA GPU, but still want to experiment with human pose estimation using AlphaPose.

## üí° Overview

AlphaPose is an accurate multi-person pose estimator that achieves state-of-the-art performance on human pose tracking and detection tasks. This version has been tailored to:
- Remove or bypass CUDA dependencies.
- Run on systems without an NVIDIA GPU.
- Be suitable for testing, learning, and small-scale CPU-based applications.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- ‚úÖ Multi-person pose estimation
- ‚úÖ Runs on **CPU-only** environment
- ‚úÖ Uses pre-trained models from original AlphaPose
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Slower inference compared to GPU-based processing

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

You will need Git installed. You can download and install [Git Bash here](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if you haven't already.

Once installed, open Git Bash and run:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/AlphaPose-CPU.git
cd AlphaPose-CPU

### 2. Install Python Dependencies
